After we finish comic strips, we will briefly share their comics as tables.

Then we will go into a live vocabulary game.
We are opening up a conversation about new technology and how it can be applied to engineering careers, and using it as a segue into our topic of energy conversions and sustainability this week.
Students will work on 1 one the following

1st and 5th Period : Copy of Forms of Energy Lab - Group

3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, : Renweable Energy Notes
Grade KE and PE worksheets and then students will design homes for “peinguins” to withstandPenguin Domain heat
Data Tracking and Student Goals


EXPLANATION
		Student explanations should precede introduction of terms or explanations by the teacher. What questions or techniques will the teacher use to help students connect their exploration to the concept under examination?
		List higher order thinking questions which teachers will use to solicit student explanations and help them to justify their explanations.



The comic strip will engourage creativity and allow students to build their own understanding of our new words before going over them more formally in class.

The game will test their quick recall of the vocabulary information
Notes Enagement :

Split up into groups by topic.

Create a summary paragraph of the topic. Share with class.

Teacher clears up misconceptions and summarizes
Students will make connections with notes at appropriate level

Students will have homework sheet

Kinetic and Potential Energy Practice_.docx
Students are designing a home for ice penguins. This allows them to use engineering design skills and see energy transformations
Students are assessing knowledge for this week’s content and then adding to their portfolio of goal setting and data tracking.

When everyone is done, we will do a team building kahoot over this week’s topics .
ELABORATION
		Describe how students will develop a more sophisticated understanding of the concept.
		What vocabulary will be introduced and how will it connect to students’ observations?
		How is this knowledge applied in our daily lives?

Students are making comic strips that must use vocbulary words to build a conncection with the words before we all go over them in class.  
Students are collaborating over the topics covered this week using Week 23 : Energy Conversions
The examples of energy conversions are applied in their daily lives as well as the conservation of energy
The individual assignments and the kinetic and potential energy sheets to build their skills with solving for kinetic or potential eneergy
Students will have a handson group project that covers budgeting, engineering design, and energy transformation.
Students can recover the information in a fun way in kahoot and increase their knowededge.


EVALUATION
		How will students demonstrate that they have achieved the lesson objective?
		This should be embedded throughout the lesson as well as at the end of the lesson
